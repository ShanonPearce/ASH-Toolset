"HRIRs (Head-Related Impulse Responses)","Inputs (external & user)","SOFA","All measurements are stored in a single SOFA dataset (e.g., a matrix of impulse responses) together with spatial dimensions and metadata. Full details: https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/SOFA_conventions","Listener-centric spherical coordinates as defined by SOFA convention. Azimuth increases counter-clockwise around the listener (0° = front). Elevation increases with height above the listener.","Refer to Supported SOFA Conventions for compatibility list."
"HRIRs (Head-Related Impulse Responses)","Internal (interim)","NPY (NumPy array)","All measurements are stored in a single .npy array per listener using the spatial format: [elevations][azimuths][channels][samples].","Elevation increases with height (min = elev = max, midpoint = listener level). Azimuth increases counter-clockwise (0° = azim < 360°, 0° = front). Channels: L, R.","Variable sample length, Stored at 44.1 kHz."
"BRIRs (Binaural Room Impulse Responses)","Outputs (exports)","SOFA, WAV","SOFA files conform to the selected SOFA convention. WAV exports include: direction-specific stereo BRIRs (one file per source direction); true-stereo BRIRs (4 channels: LL, LR, RL, RR); HeSuVi BRIRs (14 channels, 24/32-bit, 44.1/48 kHz); and 16-channel FFMPEG-compatible BRIRs.","SOFA: as per SOFA convention. WAV: positive elevation = above listener, negative = below; zero = listener level. Positive azimuth = right, negative = left.","Exported as SOFA BRIR datasets or WAV BRIRs. Refer to Supported SOFA Conventions for compatibility list. Variable elevation limits and angular resolution depending on spatial resolution. Refer to Spatial Resolutions for valid ranges and grids."
"Acoustic Spaces","Inputs (external & user)","WAV, SOFA, MAT, NPY, HDF5","Files may contain any number of channels and samples, with arbitrary bit depth and sample rate.","N/A (direction-agnostic)","Used as raw acoustic space data prior to internal transformation."
"Acoustic Spaces","Internal (interim)","NPY (NumPy array)","Each space is stored in a separate .npy array with dimensions: [listener_locations][source_locations][channels][samples].","N/A (direction-agnostic)","Stored as FIRs at 44.1 kHz."
"Low-Frequency Responses","Internal (interim)","NPY (NumPy array)","Each response is stored in a separate .npy array with dimensions: [channels][samples].","N/A","Stored as FIRs at 44.1 kHz."
"Room Targets","Internal (interim)","NPY (NumPy array)","Targets are stored in a single .npy array with dimensions: [target_id][samples].","N/A","Stored as minimum-phase FIRs at 44.1 kHz."
"Headphone Compensation","Internal (interim)","NPY (NumPy array)","Filters are stored in a single .npy array with dimensions: [filter_id][samples].","N/A","Stored as minimum-phase FIRs."
"HpCFs (Headphone Correction Filters)","Internal (interim)","SQLite database","Headphone correction filters are stored as frequency-domain responses in dB with associated metadata in SQLite databases.","N/A","ASH database and compilation database use slightly different schemas."
"HpCFs (Headphone Correction Filters)","Outputs (exports)","WAV (FIR), TXT (GEQ)","Export formats include: mono minimum-phase FIR WAV; stereo minimum-phase FIR WAV; 127-band graphic EQ; 31-band graphic EQ; and HeSuVi-compatible 127-band graphic EQ.","N/A","Exported as minimum-phase FIRs or graphic-EQ parameters, depending on format."
